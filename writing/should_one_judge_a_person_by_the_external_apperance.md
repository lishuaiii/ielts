### Should one judge a person by the external appearance?
There is an proverb "Face is the index of mind", it tells of you can know a person from his face. 
I think that we may judge a person by the external appearance, but ont only by it.

First of all, A person's external appearance will give you some information about him:
you can know whether he is like sports from his shape and muscle, whether he is wholesome from his hair, 
and his style from his clothes. These external appearances will give a initial impression for a person, 
and prepare for a further judgement.
